OS: Red-Hat Rhel 8
Vuln: bot in chat feature leaked user ssh credentials.

recon:
nmap shows 3 ports open on tcp, 22,80,443. using nikto or curl to retrieve the response header that using uncommon header "X-Backend-Server: office.paper". set the office.paper to hosts file.

foothold:
office.paper is wordpress 5.2.3 version that vulnerable to "Unauthenticated View Private/Draft Posts" see: https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/3413b879-785f-4c9f-aa8a-5a4a1d5e0ba2 for more details.

adding ?static=1&order=asd at the url is giving 404 error, so using ?static=1 only give me draft of the admin said that it has another site to chat with another person complete with the secret registration url (chat.office.paper).

signup to these chat.office.paper subdomain, read the chat. fortunately it has bot that can list and open a file directly from the server.

because the room chat is read only so we need to chat the bot privately, using bot's feature we are able to get users credential under hubbot/.env file.

login with ssh and we got user's flag.

root?

the server is running rhel 8 which is vulnerable to polkit CVE-2021-3560 (details: https://github.blog/2021-06-10-privilege-escalation-polkit-root-on-linux-with-bug/). clone the repository, and upload it to machine and boom we got root flag !.

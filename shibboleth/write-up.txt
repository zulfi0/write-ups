scan host with nmap mode tcp/udp mode to default ports. 
result :
only 2 ports are open, port 80/tcp and port 623/udp.

add shibboleth.htb to the hosts file, and i bruteforcing the vhosts with gobuster, i got 3 another domain:
monitor.shibboleth.htb
monitoring.shibboleth.htb
zabbix.shibboleth.htb

add all these vhosts to hosts file too.

so we know uncommon udp port is open at 623 running asf-rmcp
search how to exploit it in google:
https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/623-udp-ipmi
https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2013/07/02/a-penetration-testers-guide-to-ipmi/

follow these tricks to get user hash and crack it with hashcat -m 7300 mode.
once done login to zabbix.shibboleth.htb with these credentials. now go to configuration -> hosts -> items -> create new items. In column 'key' put 'system.run[reverse shell here] and boom we got shell as zabbix.

in the box only 2 users there are ipmi-svc, and root.
easy logged in to user ipmi-svc with creds we got from cracked hash.

# ROOT !
poke around seaeching running process, what can we exec with sudo, what port is running on internal server ? check every service version maybe that service is vulnerable with known CVE. port 3306 is open but we cannot log in with our creds, so try to find databases.*, .conf file, .db or file that may be contain creds for mariadb. and we got zabbix_server.conf file under /etx/zabbix directory which contain user and password for mariadb. login to mariadb 10.3.25 and it is vuln to https://github.com/Al1ex/CVE-2021-27928 
follow the instruction on the github and boom we are ROOT !

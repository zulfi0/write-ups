Vuln : Exiftool RCE


# Recon
start with scanning the target with nmap on all tcp/udp ports.
got only 2 port 80,22 on tcp. port 80 has artcorp.htb domain.
nothing really interesting on udp

bruteforcing Vhost and DNS with gobuster.
result shows no DNS subdomain only 1 VHost dev01.artcorp.htb.

# foothold.
dev01.artcorp.htb has upload file feature that will extract metadata of the png/jpg images the first thing came up to my mind is exiftool and i remember there is CVE for exiftool to gain RCE.
 CVE : CVE-2021-22204-exiftool

craft malicious image (you can use manual,metaspoit or https://github.com/convisolabs/CVE-2021-22204-exiftool). after that upload the image and boom got shell as www-data.

# LPE 1
So the box had user thomas and root, no processes running as thomas, no backup file, no config ,no .db file only root and www-data. but user thomas has cronjob running at the background (cronjobs that run on in seconds) and it runs mogrify (imagemagick) to change any file with extemsions to .png format in /var/www/metaview/convert_image/. Searching on google for how to inject a shell script to an image i found https://insert-script.blogspot.com/2020/11/imagemagick-shell-injection-via-pdf.html?m=1 that is exactly what i want.

soo immediately crafted an reverse shell in svg format upload to folder where user thomas execute the mogrify, wsit a seconds and boom got shell as thomas and stealing his ssh keys for better shell.

# LPE 2: ROOT
thomas can only run neofetch as sudo:
thomas@meta:~$ sudo -l                            Matching Defaults entries for thomas on meta:                          env_reset, mail_badpass,                                           secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bi
n\:/sbin\:/bin,
    env_keep+=XDG_CONFIG_HOME                                      
User thomas may run the following commands on meta:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/neofetch \"\"

notice the '\"\"' at the end, it prevent us for using any options !

anf notice the env_keep+=XDG_CONFIG_HOME soo it is required XDG_CONFIG_HOME in our environment:
~$ export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=(path to .config in this case on /home/thomas/.config)

edit the .config file and adding 'bash' at the beginning on the file.

now run the program with sudo:

~$ sudo neofetch

root@meta:/home/thomas/.config/neofetch# id                        uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

booom we are root.

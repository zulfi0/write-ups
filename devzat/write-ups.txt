Ip	: 10.10.11.118
Host	: devzat.htb, pets.devzat.htb
OS	: Ubuntu 20.4
Vuln	: Command Injection on parameter 'species'

# Recon
start with scan host with nmap, result: 3 open ports (80,22,8000).
Ports 8000 is ssh-go(2.0). i ran vhost fuzzing either and got another vhost pets.devzat.htb

Visit the web on port 80 and found that the port 8000 is used for chatting between users:
(local)~# ssh -l test devzat.htb -p 8000

poke around on the feature chat i got github.com/quackduck/devzat which is devzat chat room source code. analyze the code there is hidden command like '/kick,/ls,/rm,/cat'

trying the feature 1 by 1, i got error 'devbot: This command can only be ran by admins' so there is another user called admin.

logging in with 'admin' did not succeed but with 'Admin' or 'adMin' i got logging in succesfully and :

admin: Hey patrick, you there?
patrick: Sure, shoot boss!
admin: So I setup the influxdb for you as we discussed earlier in business          meeting.                                                              patrick: Cool üëç                                                             admin: Be sure to check it out and see if it works for you, will ya?
patrick: Yes, sure. Am on it!

so i got 2 users admin and patrick and running service on the servee i fluxdb, searching for related CVE i got https://github.com/LorenzoTullini/InfluxDB-Exploit-CVE-2019-20933 authentication bypass.

# Initial access 
i poked around on pets.devzat.htb, directory fuzzing i got .git directory so i dump the directory with git-dumper and got the source code. analyze the code and my logic said 'there is cmd injection on this because there is characteristic directory with animals name.

in pets.devzat.htb there is a feature to adding pets name with 2 paramater on post 'name' and 'species' try to adding special char on 'name' caused error Exit status 1.

hmmm interestring, this indicate that the server vuln to command injection.

i run netcat on listener, and inject all the params with curl and in species params, i got response from curl :D soo revshell on it.

# ROOT
Coz we know influxdb is runningon the server on port 8086 i open up https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/8086-pentesting-influxdb

and got another user password.

SUID enum shows pkexec is in SUID binary with version 0.105 this could be vuln to https://github.com/berdav/CVE-2021-4034 compile it to zip file and upload to target machine, follow the instruction amd boom we are gROOT !
